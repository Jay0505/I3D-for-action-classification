# I3D-for-action-classification

This contains the implementation of the I3D Two Stream network mentioned in the paper "Quo Vadis, Action Recognition? A New Model and the Kinetics Dataset" for the video action classification. Everything is done from the scratch and it is being trained on hmd51 dataset. Used Tensorflow 2.0 and currently the project is under training and will update with the results once the training is finished.
